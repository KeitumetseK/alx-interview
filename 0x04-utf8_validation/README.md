Description
This project involves implementing a function to validate whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. The dataset consists of a list of integers, each representing a byte of data. The goal is to ensure that these bytes conform to the UTF-8 encoding rules.

Requirements
Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Python Version: Python 3.4.3
PEP 8 Compliance: Code should adhere to PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
Executable Files: All Python scripts must be executable
Mandatory File: A README.md file at the root of the project
Concepts Applied
Bitwise Operations: Used to manipulate bits and determine if a byte is a valid start or continuation byte in UTF-8 encoding.
UTF-8 Encoding: Understanding of the UTF-8 encoding scheme and its byte patterns for characters ranging from 1 to 4 bytes.
Boolean Logic: Applied to check the validity of the UTF-8 encoded data.
