# 0x07 - Rotate 2D Matrix

## Description
This project contains a function to rotate a given n x n 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise in place. The task is to modify the matrix directly without using any additional data structures or libraries.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.10
- No external module imports allowed.
- Code must follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.0) guidelines.
- All files must end with a new line and be executable.

## Usage
The main function, `rotate_2d_matrix(matrix)`, accepts a 2D list `matrix` as input and rotates it 90 degrees clockwise in place. The function does not return any value but modifies the matrix directly.

### Example
Given the following 3x3 matrix:
```python
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
